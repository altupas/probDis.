Owing to noise, a transmitted 0 is sometimes received as a 1, and a transmitted 1 is sometimes received as a 0. For a given channel, it can be assumed that a transmitted 0 is correctly received with probability 0.95, and a transmitted 1 is correctly received with probability 0.75. Also, 70% of all messages are transmitted as a 0. If a signal is sent, determine the probability that:\n",
